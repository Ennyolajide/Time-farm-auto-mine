### Setup

1. Rename the file `example.env` to `.env` by running the command:

   ```mv example.env .env```

Alternatively, you can rename the file manually.

2. Install the required Node modules by running the command:

   ```npm install ```
   
3. Start the application by running the command:

   ```node index.js```

That's it! You should now be up and running.

Note: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
